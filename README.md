# Corpus Thomisticum Project

## Things to know:

* Design Documents folder has the sketches/layouts, not actual site images
* images folder has the images, sub folders for icons-svg and icons-png
* fonts are for reference/installing to make images, actual fonts on page will be loaded by .css from Google

## Idea Brainstorming:

### Works List Ideas:
* Drop down for views including:
* Sections (his works have been categorized into sections on topics)
* Chronological
* Mind Map/idea visualization - dynamic version of the synoptic maps?

### Reader Feature Ideas:
* Language Drop downs
* Text size adjust
* Side by side 2 languages or commentary
* Tablet/Mobile compatibility
* Readability! (The current one is not very readable)
* Specific to Thomas Aquinas references - Aristotle "The Philosopher" etc.

### Other Notes:
* Ability to do "Big Data" things with the text?
* Python with:
* CLTK - Classical Language Tool Kit (is like NLTK for classical languages)
  * Lets you do all kinds of things with words, 
  * recognizes different forms of the same word etc.
* Django - for web templates/databases.

### Future Ideas:
* Want to make digitized texts in general more useful, accessible and interesting.
(AKA Ash getting ambitious and wanting to build the Medieval/Theology Internet)
* Making them link to each other, by passages that reference each other
* Putting them into sorted databases for Big Data type things. 
* Making them more accessable.
* Allowing more people to digitize texts in this way and put them into the system? Linking between universities? (this is me thinking way ahead)
* Open Source system for such things?
